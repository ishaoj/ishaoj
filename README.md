## 🚀 About Me
Hi, I'm **Isha Ojha**, and yes—I’ve passed the “I’m not a robot” test with flying colors!  
Engineering is my chosen path, driven by a genuine love for creating, solving, and exploring new ideas.  
My journey in this field is fueled by curiosity and a desire to make a meaningful impact through technology.

Beyond the code and algorithms, I’m passionate about exploring the world, learning from diverse experiences, and seeking out new perspectives.  
This sense of discovery keeps me motivated, both professionally and personally, as I continue to grow and evolve.  

At heart, I’m an empath who values connecting with people and understanding their unique stories.  
Let’s connect and share ideas—I believe we’re all better when we explore and innovate together.
